            CAMPUS 6

          </div>
          <p>KIIT, short for Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, is one of the country’s
            top institutes for the field of IT. It was established in the year 1992.
            And even though it was established then, it opened five years later.
            Off to a slow start, the institute however did not grow slowly. It shot to the top
            and soon became the dream institute for many young aspirers. It not only has humble
            tie-ups with a number of foreign universities, but also has had the opportunity to
            inculcate the prized Indian values in students from other countries. Campus 6 refers
            to the hall and auditorium of the institute. The open-air structures offer great views
            and an even better atmosphere</p>

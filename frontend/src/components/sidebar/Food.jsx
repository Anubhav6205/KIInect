            KIIT Food Court

          </div>
          <p> The place is very helpful for the hostellers, specially KP5 and KP5A. 
            Talking about food they are good enough. Most of the items taste good, specially the sandwiches. 
            But the differences between related recipes are not distinguishable enough and most of them are little overpriced. 
            They also keep biscuits, cakes, chocolates, chips and cold drinks and that is useful.
            They best part is they stay open till lat evening for the students during semester days.</p>

            KFC

          </div>
          <p>KFC, a subsidiary of Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE: YUM.), is a global quick service restaurant 
            brand with a rich, decades-long history of success and innovation. It all started with
             one cook, Colonel Harland Sanders, who created a finger lickin' good recipe more than 
             75 years ago, a list of secret herbs and spices scratched out on the back of the door 
             to his kitchen. Today we still follow his formula for success, with real cooks breading 
             and freshly preparing our delicious chicken by hand in more than 25,000 restaurants in over 
             145 countries and territories around the world. The address of this restaurant is Plot No 62 
             & 63, Ground Floor, Chandaka Industrial Area, Opposite KIIT University, Patia, Bhubaneswar, 
             Odisha - 751024.</p>
